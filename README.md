# Portfolio_Projects
Itâ€™s a real estate price prediction project. I have built a machine learning model that can predict the property price in Bangalore based on certain 
features such as sq. ft, bedroom, bathroom, location etc. I have used the home price dataset for Bangalore city from Kaggle.com. In this project I used 
python as a programming language, Jupyter notebook as IDE, NumPy and pandas for data cleaning, matplotlib for data visualization, sklearn for model building.
